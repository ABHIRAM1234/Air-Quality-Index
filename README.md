# Air-Quality-Index

## Introduction
The air quality index (AQI) is an index for reporting the air quality on a daily basis. It is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. It is a measure of how air pollution affects one's health within a short time period. The purpose of the AQI is to help people know how the local air quality impacts their health and people can plan their day to day activities.

In this project I predict the air quality index by using data from 2013

## Data Collection
I collected data from multiple sources

### Data
1. [Weather data for Bangalore](https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/ws-432950.html) - This website consists of html pages. In html_data notebook I retrieved html weather data from 2013 to 2018. I created html files for every month of the year from 2013 to 2018]. The next this is to extract the information from these html files 
2. [AQI Data](https://openweathermap.org/) - I got the AQI data from [Krish Naik](https://github.com/krishnaik06/AQI-Project/tree/master/Data/AQI) because the website contains a paid API to get the AQI.
